## ðŸ“š What is FSGCore?

FSGCore, also known unofficially as the `FreeStyle Games Core Library`
is the library / engine on which many of the games created by 
[FSG](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft_Leamington) are based on.  

## ðŸ¤” Why are you doing this?

Since FSGCore is the base library / engine for DJ Hero 2, being able to
reverse engineer and decompile the game properly, it's required to also
reverse engineer FSGCore.

I've decided to split FSGCore and my de-compilation of DJ Hero 2 mainly
for organization purposes. Additionally it'd allow others to decompile
DJ Hero 1 more easily without also having to clone this repo into theirs.

## âš– Legal Information

While the original source code is officially owned by [FreeStyleGames Limited, 
now Ubisoft Leamington](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft_Leamington),
this has been reversed using multiple legally obtained copies of the 
game (PS3, Xbox 360).
